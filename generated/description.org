Imagine we have some kind of a service, for example, a web server running in a cloud.
We should be able to start/stop the whole server, and its parts (websites).
One way to achieve that is to use swank protocol;
this is how the web site can be controlled (and debugged) remotely.
However, it should also be able to listen to commands given by shell scripts running on the server.

A shell script
1. creates a lock directory so that everyone else knows that the conversation with the web server is started,
2. creates a file with a message in the directory, and
3. sends =USR1= signal by running =kill-s USR1 $pid= thus requesting the web server to read the message.
